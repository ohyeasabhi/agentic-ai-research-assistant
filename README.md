🧠 Agentic AI Research Assistant (Local, Multi-Agent System)

A local, agentic AI research assistant built from scratch using Python and Streamlit, powered by open-source LLMs via Ollama.
This project demonstrates core Agentic AI concepts such as planning, tool usage, self-critique, semantic memory, and evaluation — all without paid APIs.

🚀 What This Project Is

This is not a chatbot.

It is a goal-driven agentic system that:

Plans how to approach a task

Breaks it into steps

Uses tools when needed

Reviews its own output

Improves results through retries

Remembers past knowledge semantically

Everything runs locally.

✨ Key Features
🧩 Agentic Architecture

Planner Agent – breaks a topic into subtopics

Researcher Agent – gathers information per subtopic

Writer Agent – synthesizes a structured report

Critic Agent – evaluates quality and triggers retries

🛠 Tool Usage

The agent can autonomously decide to use:

Persistent memory (save important knowledge)

Calculator (for numerical reasoning)

File writer (export results)

🧠 Memory Systems

Persistent Memory – topic → summary (JSON)

Semantic Memory – meaning-based recall using embeddings + FAISS

🔁 Self-Critique Loop

The agent reviews its own output

Retries generation if quality is insufficient

Stops when an acceptable result is achieved

📊 Evaluation & Logging

Each agent run logs:

Topic

Model used

Number of retries

Tools used

Execution time

Stored locally in agent_logs.json.

🧠 Why This Is Agentic AI (Not Just LLM Usage)

This project demonstrates agent behavior, not prompt engineering.

✔ Planning before acting
✔ Role-based reasoning
✔ Tool awareness & execution
✔ Self-evaluation & retries
✔ Long-term semantic memory
✔ Observable decision metrics

These are the core building blocks of Agentic AI systems.

Each agent has one responsibility, coordinated by a central controller.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit – UI & orchestration

Ollama – local LLM runtime

Mistral / LLaMA / Neural-Chat – open-source LLMs

🧠 Author Note

This project was built for educational and portfolio purposes, focusing on clarity, correctness, and real-world agent design rather than over-engineering or frameworks.

⭐ If You’re Reviewing This Repo

This project intentionally avoids:

Paid APIs

Heavy frameworks

Black-box abstractions

The goal is to demonstrate understanding, not hide logic.
